In gen_curve.sage:
    -Currently, tries to compute the pushforward of the orientation of E0 through 
the endomorphism and the isogeny of degree l_0^h. Maybe it doesn't work simply be
-cause the curve atteigned is not oriented by alpha. (We are going through an iso
-geny of degree f*l_0^h then another isogeny of degree l_0^h. The generator for a
primitive orientation of the codomain could have norm >f, so searching for an end
-omorphism of this norm won't work probably.)
